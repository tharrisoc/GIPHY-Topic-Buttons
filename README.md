# GIPHY-Topic-Buttons
This project allows users to access the GIPHY website using buttons named
for the subject that is to be searched.

To create a search button, type one or more keywords into the search box
and then click the "Submit topic(s)" button. The new button labelled with
the words that you entered will appear in one of the rows immediately
under the page title.

To download animated gifs that match your search criteria, simply click
the button that you just created. GIPHY will return up to ten matching
gifs and display them in the browser, along with their movie ratings.
The app is set up to download only G-rated gifs. This includes PG-rated
gifs.

By default, the gifs are not animated. To start the animation on a gif,
simply click on it. It will continue to animate until you click on it
again, or refresh your browser window.
